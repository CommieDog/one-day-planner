# One Day Planner
A webpage for organizing and displaying a daily work schedule


## Introduction 

The One Day Planner is a webpage used to organize and plan the current workday's activities. The page is color-coded so users can easily see where they stand on the day's schedule. The planner also has room to write notes, and these notes are stored locally so that users can return to them afterwards.

A sample deployment of the website is available on [GitHub Pages](https://commiedog.github.io/javascript-gauntlet/).
